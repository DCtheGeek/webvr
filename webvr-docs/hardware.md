# WebVR Hardware

To view WebVR content on Microsft Edge, you use a Windows Mixed Reality headset. These headsets connect to the HDMI and USB ports of a compatible desktop or laptop computer running the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Several Windows Mixed Reality developer edition headsets are available to purchase, and more will be soon.

Hand controllers will also be available shortly. See [Windows Mixed Reality holiday update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/08/28/windows-mixed-reality-holiday-update/) for more information.

## Alternatives to headsets

If you don't currently have access to a headset, you can use the [Windows Mixed Reality Simulator](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using_the_windows_mixed_reality_simulator) to open an instance of the Microsoft Edge browser, and visit a site containing WebVR content.
