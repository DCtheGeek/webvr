# WebVR Hardware

To view WebVR content on Microsft Edge, you can use a Windows Mixed Reality headset. These headsets connect to the HDMI and USB 3 ports of compatible desktop or laptop computer, and include screens and position sensors.

Several Windows Mixed Reality developer editions are available to purchase. Hand controllers will also be available soon. See [Windows Mixed Reality holiday update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/08/28/windows-mixed-reality-holiday-update/) for more information.
